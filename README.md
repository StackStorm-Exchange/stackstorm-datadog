# Datadog Integration Pack

This StackStorm Datadog integration pack supplies action integration for Datadog.

## Configuration

Copy the example configuration in [datadog.yaml.example](./datadog.yaml.example)
to `/opt/stackstorm/configs/datadog.yaml` and edit as required.

It should look like this:
```yaml
---
app_key: '9775a026f1ca7d1c6c5af9d94d9595a4'
api_key: '87ce4a24b5553d2e482ea8a8500e71b8ad4554ff'
 ```

You can also use dynamic values from the datastore. See the
[docs](https://docs.stackstorm.com/reference/pack_configs.html) for more info.

You can generate the app and api key here: https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api

**Note** : When modifying the configuration in `/opt/stackstorm/configs/` please
           remember to tell StackStorm to load these new values by running
           `st2ctl reload --register-configs`
